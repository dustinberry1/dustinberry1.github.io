name: Text Visualization
description: This program steps through the required cleaning and preprocessing functions for basic natural language processing.  The primary reason for this project is to use visualizations to show the various transformations that can be performed on text and its overall impact to the underlying data.  We also look at the vectorization of full tweets and how data cleaning impacts their mathematical dimensionality.
