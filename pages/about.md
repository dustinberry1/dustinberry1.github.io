     A fiercely loyal teammate with strong technical skills in data science and machine learning and the ability to grasp complex concepts quickly.  In the past 18 months I have graduated #1 in my cohort of 68 with a Masters of Science in Data Science and a certificate in Machine Learning from Maryville University of St. Louis and served on a team of three to win the Department of the Army's Deep Green Data Science competition.

When I found the field of Data Science in 2019 I was immediately drawn in, and have been immersed ever since.  
     With over 22 years of miltary experience, I have honed my interpersonal skills and have the ability to assimilate into any environment to help the team achieve success.  I take pride in my ability to convey topics to others, regardless of background, and have been trusted to share ideas as a speaker in both military and civilian settings.  A few of these occasions include:  serving as the senior mentor for junior military officer classes, speaking at military graduations and formal events, being hand selected to deliver technical and strategic topics to Army staffs around the world, giving an inspirational speech at the Maryville University graduate school commencement, and representing my organization in a meeting with the Vice President of the United States...
