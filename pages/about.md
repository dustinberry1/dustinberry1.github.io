# **About Me**

<br>
A fiercely loyal teammate with strong technical skills in data science and machine learning and the ability to grasp complex concepts quickly.  In the past 18 months I have graduated #1 in my cohort of 68 with a Masters of Science in Data Science and a certificate in Machine Learning from Maryville University of St. Louis and competed on a team of three to win the Department of the Army's Deep Green Data Science competition.  My journey with data began in 2006 on my first deployment overseas where I scrubbed information to manually build a rudimentary pattern analysis tool that provided me the ability to predict the emplacement time and location of improvised explosive devices.  That modeling experience stayed with me over the years in various military roles, always pushing me to quantify my surroundings and seach deeper for answers.  When I found the field of Data Science in 2019 I was immediately drawn in, and have been immersed ever since.  With over 22 years of miltary experience, I have honed my interpersonal skills and have the ability to assimilate into any environment to help the team achieve success.  I take pride in my ability to convey topics to others, regardless of background, and have been trusted to share ideas as a speaker in both military and civilian settings including being selected as a senior mentor for junior military officers    analytical, and organizational skills who works alongside leaders at all levels to achieve strategic goals and mission success. Fiercely loyal and results drivenExperienced in data science, predictive analytics, machine learning, operations management, and data driven problem solving across a diverse set of organizations.
