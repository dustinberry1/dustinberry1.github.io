# **About Me**

<br>
As a seasoned military engineer officer, I am equally comfortable navigating both complexity and ambiguity. This momentum as a “complexity/ambiguity native” served as the primary catalyst behind my mid-career transition into data science and machine learning.

This 24-month transition included:
<ul>
  <li>Graduating at the top of my class for a Master’s of Science in Data Science from Maryville University of St. Louis</li>
  <li>Earning a certificate in Machine Learning (ML) from Maryville University of St. Louis</li>
  <li>Serving on a team of three to win the Department of the Army’s 2021 Deep Green Data Science Competition</li>
<body>
While my official data science journey began just over two years ago, I am by no means new to data. My practical experience grappling with data started 16 years ago. During my first combat tour in 2006, I wrangled data and built a rudimentary pattern analysis tool, empowering my military unit with the ability to predict the emplacement time and location of improvised explosive devices.

That experience with predictive analytics always burned bright in my memory and immediately attracted me to the field of data science when I was exposed to it in 2019.

By uniquely combining 22 years of military service and advanced data science/ML training, I can add a rare combination of honed communication ability, interpersonal flexibility, situational adaptability, and technical skills to any data science team.
